- [ ] Incorporate proper benchmark
    - Following BLL, our benchmark trading rule for the mean return perfor- mance measure is the “null” system, which is always out of the market. Consequently, S0 is always zero. An alternative interpretation, also empha- sized by BLL ~p. 1741!, is to regard a long position in the DJIA as the bench- mark and superimpose the trading signals on this market index. According to this second interpretation a buy signal translates into borrowing money at the risk-free interest rate and doubling the investment in the stock index, a “neutral” signal translates into simply holding the stock index, and a sell signal translates into a zero position in the stock index ~i.e., out of the market!. - Sullivan et al 1999
